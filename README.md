Complete the function displayPathtoPrincess which takes in two parameters - the integer N and the character array grid.

 The grid will be formatted exactly as you see it in the input, so for the sample input the princess is at grid[2][0]. 
 
 The function shall output moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP or DOWN) on consecutive lines to rescue/reach the princess. The goal is to reach the princess in as few moves as possible.

The above sample input is just to help you understand the format. The princess ('p') can be in any one of the four corners.
